Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. 
Instead of following fixed rules, ML systems analyze historical data to find trends and relationships, allowing them to make predictions or classifications on new data. 
Common types of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 
Supervised learning relies on labeled datasets to train predictive models, while unsupervised learning
