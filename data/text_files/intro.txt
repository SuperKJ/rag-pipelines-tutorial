    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming every aspect of modern life. 
From personalized recommendations on streaming platforms to autonomous vehicles and 
AI-powered healthcare diagnostics, machine learning models are driving innovation 
across industries. In particular, generative AI models such as GPT and diffusion 
networks have opened new possibilities for creativity, automation, and research. 
However, as AI systems become more capable, concerns around ethics, transparency, 
and data privacy have grown. Organizations are now focusing not only on performance 
but also on responsible AI practices, ensuring fairness, explainability, and safety 
in deployment. The future of AI will likely depend on striking the right balance 
between innovation and governance.
